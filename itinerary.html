<p>
My ability to travel across borders is highly dependent on COVID restrictions, so there will certainly be changes as my journey progresses. For now, here's my plan: <br>


<h5> December: Toulouse, France </h5>
<h5> January: Rishikesh, India </h5>
<h5> February: Singapore (here now!)</h5>
<h5> March - Mid April: Limerick, Ireland / Vitoria or São Paulo, Brazil</h5>
<h5> Mid April - end of May: Nagoaka, Japan</h5>
<h5> June: Athens, Greece</h5>
<h5> July - Mid August: Zürich, Switzerland</h5>

<p> If you happen to have any contacts in these regions, even if not in the food or microbiology spaces, I would love to hear from you! </p>
